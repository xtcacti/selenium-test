Log4j - log levels

TRACE
Most detailed information. Expect these to be written to logs only. Since version 1.2.12

DEBUG
Detailed information on the flow through the system. Expect these to be written to logs only. Generally speaking, most lines logged by your application should be written as DEBUG

INFO
Interesting runtime events (startup/shutdown). Expect these to be immediately visible on a console, so be conservative and keep to a minimum.

WARN
Use of deprecated APIs, poor use of API, 'almost' errors, other runtime situations that are undesirable or unexpected, but not necessarily "wrong". Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.

ERROR
Other runtime errors or unexpected conditions. Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.

FATAL
Severe errors that cause premature termination. Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.

OFF
The highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.

** built-in log levels with increasing order of severity

helpful tips

You can configure to append or overwrite logs in file

You can set logging OFF when not required
in case heavy logging is making your runs slower...

Log4j  - Configuration File

Log4j is configured through a configuration file

Configuration files can be written in XML, JSON, YAML, or properties file format

Set of key-value pairs

Within a configuration you can define three main components: 
Loggers
Appenders
Layouts

Configuring logging via a file has the advantage that logging can be turned on or off without modifying the application that uses Log4j.
