For integration with Jenkins + Git : When you have provided your github url in the git section of jenkins job, when you run your job you can goto the logs and see the location where the project is cloned from github on the system, you can use the same folder location in your commands. Another way is you can put the parent folder location in Jenkins job ＞ General ＞ Advanced ＞ Custom workspace. Now all locations will be taken relative to this so you can only provide the location starting from here. For example you can see this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6Ty0...
